# Research-Paper-Topic-Modeling
This is my Novel Deep Learning Project

• Project involved finding out the best language model to summarize the abstracts of the research. I considered all
the state of the art language models suitable for this task and test them and even combined models to check for
better accuracies

• Analyzed different topic modeling models for research paper abstracts using the prominent methods: TF-IDF,
BERT, LDA, BERT+LDA. The BERTopic model performed well in terms of coherence and silhouette scores,
indicating strong semantic similarity among words in the topics, and well-separated topic clusters.

• We observed that BERT+LDA model performed the best in labelling the research papers. Now, this pre-trained
model can also be used for all the topic modeling downstream tasks accurately. These models are very useful to for
effective storing and retrievals of large file systems.
